# ABAP Programming Homework

This project is meant to create a simple Fiori example application. It displays a list of programming languages with some information and user reviews. When clicking on a detail page, you see all the information listed and also every single review for each language.

The application also provides popularity information based on GitHub statistics, which are fetched from our own webservice using Google BigQuery inside a Firebase Cloud-Function.
Note: The webservice is beeing shut down after the final handover (15.05.2020). If you want to test this application please contact us.
There are also many validation and determination functions running in the background. For example we determine the average rating each time, a review is beeing created.
